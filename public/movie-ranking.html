<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
    <p>Ever wonder what you'd get when you combine a great storyline, superb acting, drama AND comedy all in one film? Look no further than Forrest Gump. This action filled, tear jerker will have your eyes glued to the film from beginning to end.</p>
<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
    <p>Comedy at its finest! Of course this humor isn't for everbody... but if you live on planet earth and have any sense of joy then you'll be laughing your ass off with this classic!</p>
<h3>Insert Movie Here</h3>
